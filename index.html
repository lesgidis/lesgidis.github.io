<h3>Personal Information </h3>
<p align="justify">

  My name is Nikolaos Lesgidis and currently I am leading the FEM software development in Deep Excavation LLC. I try to remain active in academia thus I do work from time to time on topics I find interesting. 
Â I have created this website as a code and software sharing platform, thus you will find a number of scripts/executables complementary to my published work.
