<h3>Personal Information </h3>
<p align="justify">
My name is Nikolaos Lesgidis and I have recently finished my PhD at the Civil Engineering Department of Aristotle University, 
  Thessaloniki, Greece. I have created this website to be used as a code and software sharing platform, thus you will find a number of 
  scripts complementary to my published work, along with the release executables 
  of any freely distributed software i have solely or co-developed in the past.
