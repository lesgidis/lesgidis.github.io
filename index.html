<h3>Personal Information </h3>
<p align="justify">

  My name is Dr. Nikolaos Lesgidis and currently I am leading the finite element analysis development for the geotechnical engineering software 
  company Deep Excavation LLC. I try to remain active in academia thus I do publish from time to time on topics I find interesting. 
Â I have created this website to be used as a code and software sharing platform, thus you will find a number of scripts complementary to my published work. 
  Additionally, you will find links to release executables for any freely distributed software I have developed in the past.
