Bridge Wizard is an interactive front-end software for the seismic analysis and assessment of bridge structures, 
  that takes advantage of a sophisticated, Open-Source software for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) 
  to provide through its graphical userâ€™s interface: (a) conceptual assistance during the finite element analysis 
  pre- and post-processing (b) finite element model development automations and (c) expert advice for 
  modeling various bridge-specific issues that are key for the reliable prediction of structural response 
  (such as boundary conditions, pier-deck connections, soil-structure interaction etc). 
  Bridge Wizard improves the efficiency and credibility of the finite element modeling developed, particularly 
  for the case of complex bridge structures and gives the designer more control in critical modeling decisions 
  affecting the overall system response.
