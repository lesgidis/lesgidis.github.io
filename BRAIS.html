  BRAIS is an interactive front-end software for the seismic analysis and assessment of bridge structures, 
  that takes advantage of the sophisticated Open-Source software for Earthquake Engineering Simulation OpenSees.
  The developed integrated system is organized into four main modules dedicated to 
  (a) the optimized construction and model order reduction of the FEM model realizations essential to the assessment procedure,
  (b) uncertainty evaluation and stochastic sampling,
  (c) the ground motion selection of the earthquake excitation included in the fragility assessment of the bridge structure in question and 
  (d) the probabilistic quantification of damage at each individual bridge-soil component and at the system level.
